Project Description

Here's what your Ruby on Rails application must do:

1.     Your app must accept (via a form) a CSV file.  You can assume the columns will always be in the same order, that there will always be data in each column, and that there will always be a header line. 

  a.) DONE ... An example input file named example_input.csv should accompany this code challenge.

2.     DONE ... Your app must parse the given file and store the information in a database.
3.     After upload, your application should output:
a.     DONE... A list of the auctions (name and city)
b.     DONE ... The number of vehicles each auction has sold
c.     DONE ... The total profit the auction made selling those vehicles
          i.          profit = winning_bid - seller_payout
d.     DONE ... The average profit the auction made per vehicle.


Your application does not need to be aesthetically pleasing, and should be easy to set up and run on either Linux or Mac OS X. It should not require any for-pay software.
